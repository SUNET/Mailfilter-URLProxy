# URLProxy (CanIt)

"URLProxy" is a feature in CanIt-Domain-PRO email filtering software, that
handles rewritten (proxied) URLs in emails that has been rewritten
(based on rules of the CanIt-Domain-PRO system).
The rewritten URLs will take the users to a URLProxy landing page,
with some basic information around the original URL, like:
hosting domain, country etc.

This simple web-app emulates that basic landing page logic of that component,
so previosly handled emails with rewritten URLs doesn't become broken links.
